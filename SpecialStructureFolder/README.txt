In this project we used a RootDataStructure interface and a MyList, MyQueue, and MySet interface which all extend RootDataStructure to implement a List, Queue, and Set style data structure.

Our Set implementation (MySetImpl.java) is a generic class implementing MySet.java.

Our List and Queue implementation (MyListQueue.Java found in the lists folder) is a generic class that implements both MyList.java and MyQueue.java. This allows it to serve as either a List or a Queue, depending on how it is instantiated.
