# Who-Needs-Collection-API
To be the best collection that we can be

We finished adding new classes for the project. Those classes are ListAndQAbstract.java which is an interface, and MyListAndQ.java which is a concrete class that have both
list and queue data structures. 

ListAndQAbstract have the following abstract methods:

-add function that add an element to a specific index.
-get function that return element at a specific index.
-getIndex function that return index for a specific element.
-update function that change an element at a specific index.
and print method for toString display of collection data.

We are still working on the Print() methods and some of the implemented methods in MyListAndQ class because we still have bugs in our codes that needed to be fixed. 

We also have not implemented the Set class and its functions and will need more to work on it.
